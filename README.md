# Traveling Salesman Problem With Draft Limits

This repository contains implementations to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem With Draft Limits (TSP-DL).

1. The first implementation is a Tabu Search algorithm written in C. The graphs are represented as adjacency matrices.

## Problem Description

The Traveling Salesman Problem With Draft Limits is a variant of the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that incorporates the concept of draft limits. In this problem, a ship needs to visit a set of ports exactly once and return to the starting one while adhering to draft limits. Each port is associated with a draft limit, which represents ------- can travel from that port before returning to it.

The objective is to find the shortest tour that satisfies the draft limits for each port. This problem is NP-hard, making it challenging to find an optimal solution for larger instances. Tabu Search is a heuristic algorithm commonly used to solve TSP and its variants efficiently.

## Instances

All the instances solved by our codes are available on:  <http://jgr.no/tspdl>.

Also, you can use our instances, that are already ready to use with our implementation.

The instances names are on the following format ```name#p_#d_#n``` where:

+ name: Name of the subset of instances.
+ \#p: Number of ports on the instances.
+ \#d: % of ports with restrictive draft limit
+ \#n: Id of the instance.

Possible combinations of name and #p are:

+ burma14
+ ulysses16, ulysses22
+ gr17, gr21, gr48
+ fri26
+ bayg29

\#d can assume values 10, 25, 50;
and \#n varies from 1 to 10.

There are other instances with more than one hundred ports, but they require special treatment to be addressed. So, for now, they won't be addressed in this repository.

## Implementation

### Tabu Search Algorithm

The Tabu Search algorithm is a metaheuristic that iteratively explores the solution space while maintaining a memory structure to avoid revisiting previously explored solutions. It uses various mechanisms to guide the search towards better solutions.

The C implementation in this repository provides a basic yet efficient Tabu Search algorithm for solving the TSP-DL. It incorporates features such as neighborhood exploration, tabu list management, and aspiration criteria to find high-quality solutions within a reasonable amount of time.

## Requirements for Development in C

To work on or modify this C implementation, you will need the following software tools and resources:

1. **C Compiler**: You'll need a C compiler to build and run the C code. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is a popular and widely used compiler for C programming and is available on various platforms.

2. **Code Editor or IDE**: A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) is essential for writing and editing the C source code. Some popular choices include [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), and [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/).

3. **Git (optional)**: If you want to clone and manage the repository, you can use [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a version control system. Git allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your code.

## Usage

To use the Tabu Search implementation for solving the TSP-DL, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/bruno-duart/TSPDL.git
   ```

2. Compile the C code:

    ```shell
    gcc file_name.c -o output
    ```

3. Run the executable with an input file:

    ```shell
    ./output input.txt
    ```

    Make sure to provide an input file with the necessary information, including the cities, distances between them, and draft limits.

## Input Format

The input file should be in a specific format, typically containing the following information:

- Number of ports.
- Adjacency matrix representing distances between ports.
- Demand of each port.
- Draft limits for each ports.
- Extra - If you plan to use the instances provided by our repository, take note that we provided the optimal cost of each instance

### Example input file

The below example is from ```burma14_10_1``` instance.
